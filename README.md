Versiq - A Modern E-commerce Experience

  Versiq is a high-end menswear e-commerce platform built from the ground up to provide a top-tier digital experience. The project focuses on a sophisticated design aesthetic, fluid animations, and a seamless user journey from product discovery to a secure checkout.


About The Project
  The goal of this project was to create a complete and immersive e-commerce brand experience. Every component, from the navbar's entrance animation to the product card's hover effects, was meticulously designed and implemented to reflect a premium, modern, and confident brand identity. The entire application is fully responsive, offering a flawless experience on all devices.

Key Features
  This project is packed with features that define a modern, high-end e-commerce platform:

Homepage & Core Design
  - Dynamic Hero Section: Features an animated headline with custom SVG highlights and an interactive 3D product carousel.
  - "The Versiq Standard" Section: A unique, asymmetrical "zigzag" layout that showcases brand values with scroll-triggered animations.
  - "Most Wanted" Stepped Gallery: A sophisticated, responsive gallery with descending heights and a "spotlight & expand" hover effect that enlarges the focused product.
  - "Featured" Section: A dynamic 70/30 split-panel layout with a smooth, cinematic transition that animates based on which card is hovered.
  - "Styled by Versiq" Community Gallery: A playful, fanned-out display of community images with an animated "pop-up" call-to-action on hover.
  - Professional Preloader: A lightweight, font-embedded preloader in the initial HTML to prevent font flashing and layout shift, ensuring a polished first impression.

Core E-commerce & UX Flow
  - Advanced Collections Page: A modern "Command Bar" layout featuring a slide-in panel for multi-faceted filtering (Pattern, Color, Arrival, Sorting). The product grid animates smoothly as filters are applied.
  - Sophisticated Product Detail Page: Features a sticky details column that stays in view while the user scrolls through a multi-image gallery. Includes a self-contained and fully functional "You Might Also Like" section.
  - Seamless Authentication: A single, unified AuthPage for both Login and Sign Up, featuring a beautiful "split-material" card with a smooth, animated sliding transition between the two forms.
  - Persistent Cart: The shopping cart state is saved to localStorage, so users never lose their items on refresh. It also includes logic to merge a guest cart with a user's account upon login.
  - Comprehensive UI Components: Fully themed and functional components for the Cart Drawer, Wishlist, Contact Page, and a multi-step Checkout Flow.

Design & System Philosophy
  The entire website is built upon a cohesive and strictly implemented design system.
    - Color Palette: A custom two-color primary scheme of Mulberry Wine (#551c25) and Frost Mist (#dfe8ed), used to generate a full semantic theme (primary, secondary, accent, card, background, etc.).
    - Typography: A professional typographic hierarchy was established:
        Logo Font: Agfiustur
        Display Font (Headlines): KS Bistra
        Body/UI Font: Nohemi
    - Layout: A strong emphasis on white space, balanced layouts, and a consistent responsive grid system.
